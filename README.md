# Omnifood
A one-page landing site of a fictitious food delivery company.

This is a simple one-page website featuring the fictitious Omnifood brand. This is built and taught from a Udemy course RWD and Development with HTML5 and CSS3.

The site also uses subtle animations using jQuery. Another version will make use of different tools/ languages to enhance the landing page's performance and development time.
